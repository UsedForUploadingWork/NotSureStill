            Optimism and Caution: While most respondents are optimistic about AI’s potential to drive progress, there is also caution regarding its societal impacts. The concerns about job loss and uncertainty highlight the need for careful consideration of AI’s broader effects on the workforce and society. Efficiency and Utility: The emphasis on AI’s usefulness and efficiency suggests that many see its value in enhancing productivity and optimizing processes. However, the fact that only a small percentage specifically cited efficiency indicates that while important, it may not be the primary focus for most respondents. Mixed Perceptions: The small but notable minority that is unsure or views AI as non-progressive indicates that there is still some scepticism and ambivalence about AI's role in society. This suggests a need for ongoing dialogue and education about AI’s potential benefits and risks.

            Overall many of the responses tend to see AI developent as progressive due to it's fast paced advancement and due to the fact that it could be useful for society and that further development could lead to more efficient processes. However, some responses do consider the problem of potential job loss due to AI replacing people as it becomes more efficient.

        <h3>In schools AI can be used for many things, including but not exclusive to; Personalized Learning in that AI can act as virtual tutors, offering tailored explanations and feedback, helping students understand complex subjects, AI can also be used to create content by generating lesson plans quizzes and many other materials. AI can also be used in terms of assisting with spelling, grammar and writing improvements. With a key example of AI that does this being Grammarly.AI also tends to have many use cases within many different industries such as; Being capable of aiding medical diagnostics and creating personalised treatment plans, Capable of detecting fraud and helps to power trading and customer service within financing, Is capable of predicting maintenance needs and schedules within manufacturing systems as well as ensure quality control and boost efficiency within factories, capable of organising delivery routes to locations as well as controlling traffic across the entirety of Melbourne to ensure high speed transport, capable of running energy grids and making energy distribution more efficient, helping to automate farming practices and machinery as well as detecting pests, and capable of analysing and reviewing legal documents, and predicting case outcomes to help streamline the legal industry.</h3>

        <h2>Overall, AI's benefits include increased efficiency, enhanced personalization, better decision-making, and the creation of new opportunities across various sectors. As AI continues to evolve, its positive impact on industry, education, and society as a whole is likely to expand, though it also requires careful management to address challenges such as job displacement and ethical concerns. AI itself is helpful within schooling as it can support personalized learning styles by adapting educational content to individual student needs, make education more accessible and engaging, and assist teachers in creating lesson plans, grading assignments, and providing feedback, saving time and allowing for more focus on student interaction and any tutoring the students may need.<br>Furthermore ai helps in many industries through streamlining operations and automating routine tasks, optimizing supply chains, and predicting maintenance needs. It enhances productivity by analysing vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, enabling better decision-making. In sectors like healthcare, AI aids in diagnostics and treatment planning, improving patient outcomes. Additionally, AI-driven innovation drives new products and services, opening up opportunities for growth and competitiveness between organisations. <br> All this and AI can still help the general population with its varied use cases. As it can enhance daily life, making services more efficient and accessible and improves public safety through predictive policing and traffic management systems. AI also contributes to environmental sustainability by optimizing energy use and supporting smart city initiatives. Additionally, AI has the potential to address global challenges, such as healthcare access, by providing remote diagnostics and treatment support in underserved areas.</h2>

        <h1> Despite all of these benefits of AI and various use cases that could help revolutionise many aspects of human society, AI also presents several dangers within society, industry, and schooling. Raising concerns about ethics, job displacement, and various other unintended consequences that originate from over reliance and complacency. Some of these dangers for general society being  a greater class divide between those who can access more advanced AI models as they could leverage this quality gap to further separate classes. It also raises many privacy concerns as the companies that develop these AI could collect the questions posed to it and if given more control over devices within daily life could even learn about more private data. Not only could AI pose a threat to everyday life, but it could even threaten the success of many industries and the job security of many individuals given that their tasks are skill-less and could be easily automated. With large amounts of job loss in areas such as retail, manufacturing, and transportation. This could result in an increase in unemployment rates across large amounts of society and even further lead to the class divide previously mentioned. With a key focus on the legal industry as AI could almost completely replace legal advice, and with AI tools could reduce the workload so much so that costs of lawyers might drop due to the lack of effort required to prepare a legal case. And lastly, AI itself could actually negatively affect schooling practices, aligning with many of the worries of respondents. With overreliance on these AI systems leading to a lack in learning and potential of cheating within many importance exams that gauge the abilities of students. Imagine having thousands of doctors, all of which hadn’t learnt a single thing within their schooling having to take care of the masses. Furthermore this could result in large amounts of the populus not knowing anything and lots of information being lost to the past not transferred through teaching. Overall if AI isn’t properly used and managed it could pose an incredible threat to society and humanity itself as we become complacent and lose control over society.</h1>
